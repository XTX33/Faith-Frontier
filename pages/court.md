  <h1>Court &amp; Case Transparency</h1>
  <p class="section-lead">
    This section documents and explains real legal matters involving
    <strong>Devon Tyler Barber</strong> and the <strong>Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust</strong>.
    Each case is presented in plain English so readers can see how filings, hearings,
    and rulings connect to larger questions of public trust, due process, and access
    to justice in New Jersey courts.
  </p>
  <p class="text-muted">
    The purpose of this archive is educational and ethical: to make complex proceedings
    readable and transparent, and to encourage lawful, faith-grounded engagement with
    civil, criminal, and administrative systems. Nothing here is legal advice and nothing
    creates an attorney–client relationship.
