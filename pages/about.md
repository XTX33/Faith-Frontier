  <h1>About Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    <strong>Faith Frontier</strong> serves as a public documentation portal at the intersection of law, conscience, and institutional accountability —
    preserving public records and faith-based analysis as a form of civic stewardship.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>
    The Trust exists to promote integrity and transparency in public institutions by documenting legal proceedings,
    administrative actions, and faith-based moral reasoning. Each publication — whether a case record,
    essay, or reform analysis — is intended to illuminate how justice, equity, and compassion can function
    within public governance frameworks.
  </p>

  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>
    Founded by <strong>Devon Tyler Barber</strong> in New Jersey, Faith Frontier emerged from direct
    experience in courts, labor disputes, and administrative proceedings. The project began as documentation
    of personal litigation and evolved into an ecclesiastical trust — a public ministry of evidence,
    faith-based analysis, and institutional reform advocacy.
  </p>

  <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stewardship:</strong> Manage truth and public record with care and accountability, not control.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Ensure every filing, motion, and analysis is publicly accessible and verifiable.</li>
    <li><strong>Reform:</strong> Transform individual experience into precedent and analysis that serves the public interest.</li>
    <li><strong>Faith:</strong> Hold justice accountable to moral and spiritual principles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Organizational Structure</h2>
  <p>
    The Trust operates as an independent, faith-based public-interest documentation project. It is not a law firm,
    political organization, or advocacy group in the conventional sense, but rather an educational and moral enterprise.
    The Proprietor maintains ownership of all intellectual and creative property in stewardship for future use.
  </p>

  <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
  <p class="text-muted">
    <em>"Conscience is not bound by office or title — it is bound by truth and the obligation to serve the public good."</em>
