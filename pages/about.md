    <h1>About Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      <strong>Faith Frontier</strong> is an ecclesiastical trust and ministry of record:
      a place where court filings, public documents, and personal testimony are gathered,
      not as spectacle, but as evidence of how law and conscience collide in real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work sits at the edge between church and courthouse, asking a simple question:
      <strong>What does justice look like when we actually put it on paper?</strong>
    </p>

<section class="section section-alt" aria-labelledby="mission-heading">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 id="mission-heading">Mission</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      To steward legal records, lived experience, and moral reflection as a public trust
      — so that others can see how systems really behave, and how they might be reformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier exists to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Document</strong> — Preserve filings, orders, and correspondence that show how power is used in practice.</li>
      <li><strong>Interpret</strong> — Read those records through Scripture, conscience, and basic fairness, not only through procedure.</li>
      <li><strong>Teach</strong> — Offer plain-language explanations so that ordinary people can understand what is happening in their name.</li>
      <li><strong>Reform</strong> — Turn individual hardship into patterns of evidence that can inform change in policy, practice, and culture.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-muted">
      This is not a think tank or a law firm. It is a ministry of <em>witness</em> — to what has happened,
      to what should have happened, and to what might yet be redeemed.

  <div class="container">
    <h2 id="origins-heading">Origins</h2>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier grew out of one tradesman’s collision with the legal system. 
      <strong>Devon Tyler Barber</strong>, a New Jersey tile contractor and pro se litigant, began collecting 
      his own case files simply to survive: toll disputes, criminal charges, post-conviction petitions, 
      malpractice claims, and civil-rights suits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, a pattern emerged. The files were no longer just “personal cases” — they were a
      <strong>living record</strong> of how agencies, courts, and professionals handled truth, error,
      poverty, disability, and faith under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of that lived record came three decisions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>To place the work under an <strong>ecclesiastical trust</strong>, acknowledging that stewardship belongs to God first.</li>
      <li>To treat each case as both a legal controversy and a <strong>teaching parable</strong> about public trust.</li>
      <li>To invite others to read, question, and test the evidence for themselves.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-muted">
      The name “Faith Frontier” reflects that edge-space where law, conscience, and spiritual calling meet —
      often uncomfortably — and where new paths have to be cut instead of inherited.

<section class="section section-alt" aria-labelledby="pillars-heading">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 id="pillars-heading">Core Pillars</h2>
    <div class="grid-2">
      <div>
        <h3>1. Stewardship of Record</h3>
        <p>
          Public documents are not just paperwork; they are testimonies. Faith Frontier treats
          filings, orders, and letters as <strong>evidence of how authority is exercised</strong>.
          Preserving them in context allows future readers to see the whole story, not just a verdict.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>2. Transparency & Verifiability</h3>
        <p>
          Whenever possible, assertions are tethered to <strong>actual, accessible documents</strong>.
          The goal is not to ask for blind trust, but to make it easier for others to verify,
          question, or challenge what is presented here.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>3. Conscience Over Convenience</h3>
        <p>
          Courts and agencies often favor efficiency. This project insists that
          <strong>conscience, not convenience</strong>, must govern how people are treated.
          That conviction drives both the litigation and the reflections published here.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>4. Reform Through Witness</h3>
        <p>
          Faith Frontier does not pretend that one person’s cases will “fix” a system.
          But a clear record can <strong>help others recognize patterns</strong>, choose better policies,
          and resist practices that quietly harm the vulnerable.
        </p>

    <h2 id="trust-structure-heading">Ecclesiastical Trust & Ministry</h2>
    <p>
      Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust functions as a <strong>holding body</strong> for the records,
      writings, and ministry work associated with these cases. It is complemented by
      <a href="{{ '/posts/ministry-charter/' | relative_url }}">Faith Frontier Ministry</a>, 
      an unincorporated church body with its own charter and worship life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, they serve three intertwined roles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archive:</strong> preserving documents and timelines for public education.</li>
      <li><strong>Ministry:</strong> grounding the work in prayer, worship, and pastoral care.</li>
      <li><strong>Workshop:</strong> testing ideas about reform, stewardship, and common law in real cases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-muted">
      None of this is legal representation. It is a form of public discipleship — bringing 
      matters of law and public trust into the light of faith.

      If you’re here, you’re probably already carrying questions about justice, authority,
      and what faith has to do with either.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Start with the cases:</strong> Visit the 
        <a href="{{ '/cases/' | relative_url }}">Case Records</a> to see the underlying facts and filings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Read the reflections:</strong> Explore 
        <a href="{{ '/revelations/' | relative_url }}">Common Law Revelations</a> and 
        <a href="{{ '/faith/' | relative_url }}">faith essays</a> that draw out the themes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Test everything:</strong> Compare what you read here with Scripture, constitutional text,
        and your own sense of fairness. The goal is not agreement, but honest discernment.

    </ul>

      If anything on this site helps you see your own situation more clearly, or ask better questions in your
      own jurisdiction, then the Trust has done part of its work.
