  <h1>About Faith Frontier Ecclesiastical Trust</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    <strong>Faith Frontier</strong> documents the intersection of law, conscience, and stewardship—preserving public records and moral reasoning as a form of public trust.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>
    The Trust exists to restore integrity and transparency to civic processes through the integration of legal literacy and theological reflection. Each publication—case records, essays, and reform briefs—illuminates the interrelation of justice, equity, and mercy within public frameworks.
  </p>

  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>
    Founded by <strong>Devon Tyler Barber</strong> in New Jersey, Faith Frontier arose from direct
    experience in courtrooms, labor disputes, and public agencies. The project began as a record
    of personal litigation and evolved into an ecclesiastical trust—a living ministry of evidence,
    faith, and reform.
  </p>

  <h2>Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stewardship:</strong> Handle truth and public record with care, not control.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Let every filing, motion, and act of conscience be visible and verifiable.</li>
    <li><strong>Reform:</strong> Turn personal experience into precedent that serves others.</li>
    <li><strong>Faith:</strong> Keep justice accountable to higher moral law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Structure</h2>
  <p>
    The Trust operates as an independent, faith-based public-interest record. It is not a law firm
    or political entity, but an educational and moral enterprise. The Proprietor maintains ownership
    of all intellectual and creative property in stewardship for future generations.
