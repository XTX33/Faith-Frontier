# Ecclesiastical & Historical Archives

This section preserves older ecclesiastical and historical materials that inform
the Faith Frontier project — not headline cases, but the roots of the ideas.

- [Eleven Banned Foods](11-banned-foods.md)
- [Geneva Bible Scroll Notes](geneva-bible-scroll.md)
- [Thomas Becket Proclamation](thomas-becket-proclamation.md)

These pieces show how conscience, scripture, and history frame the way I look at
modern law and public trust in New Jersey.
