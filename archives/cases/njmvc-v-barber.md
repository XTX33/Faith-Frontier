summary: >
  Barber filed an administrative appeal challenging the New Jersey MVC’s automated
  suspension of his driving privileges without adequate notice or hearing. The petition
  alleges that the agency’s “Notice of Proposed Suspension” workflow fails to provide
  constitutionally adequate notice under N.J. Const. art. I, ¶ 1 and that the
  online-only reinstatement process violates ADA Title II access-to-justice standards.

faith_note: >
  This case asks whether routine enforcement systems can still reflect mercy and
  fairness—requiring that even automated processes respect the dignity, limitations,
  and procedural rights of the people they govern.

## Overview

This administrative action seeks review of a summary license suspension allegedly
issued through the NJ MVC’s automated “Notice of Proposed Suspension” system.
Barber contends that he did not receive meaningful notice of the proposed action,
and that reinstatement was conditioned on navigating an online process that was
not reasonably accessible given his circumstances and needs.

The petition argues that MVC’s suspension procedures:

- Fail to provide adequate and timely notice and opportunity to be heard;
- Rely on automated workflows that do not reliably reach the affected driver; and
- Require online steps that may exclude or burden individuals with disabilities,
  contrary to ADA Title II obligations.

## Key Issues

1. **Administrative Due Process**  
   Whether NJ MVC’s automated suspension notices satisfy due process under
   N.J. Const. art. I, ¶ 1, including clear notice of the proposed action,
   the basis for the suspension, and meaningful opportunity to contest it.

2. **ADA Title II Compliance**  
   Whether an online-first or online-only reinstatement process denies qualified
   individuals with disabilities equal access to the means of preserving or
   restoring their driving privileges.

3. **Public-Trust Obligations of Licensing Authorities**  
   Whether a state licensing authority, acting in a gatekeeping role over the
   ability to work, travel, and care for family, must exercise its enforcement
   power with heightened transparency, proportionality, and attention to the
   circumstances of ordinary motorists.
