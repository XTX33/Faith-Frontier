    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      These coordinated petitions seek post-conviction relief under
      <strong>N.J. Ct. R. 3:22</strong>, asserting violations of the
      <strong>Sixth</strong> and <strong>Fourteenth Amendments</strong>.
      The filings collectively allege ineffective assistance of counsel,
      suppression of exculpatory evidence, and broader due-process concerns
      arising from the 2022–2024 proceedings.

    <h2>Context & Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This unified presentation exists to enhance transparency and public understanding of
      New Jersey’s post-conviction review process. It consolidates records that would
      otherwise appear piecemeal across multiple dockets and filing systems, allowing
      readers to follow the procedural and constitutional questions in full context.
