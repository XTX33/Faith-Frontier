## ✦ Thematic Foundation

Faith Frontier draws from *Tiller Earth Foundation* principles:
- Work is sacred when it serves others.
- Law is sacred when it protects the weak.
- Light is sacred when it exposes injustice without hatred.

Together they form a covenant between conscience and governance —  
that both citizen and state must act in truth.
