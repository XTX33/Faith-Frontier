summary: >
  The New Jersey Turnpike Authority ("NJTA") filed a Special Civil Part action
  seeking $5,109.45 in alleged unpaid tolls and administrative fees arising from
  travel on its toll roads. Earlier billing and collection efforts were pursued
  under docket ATL-DC-007956; the present docket ATL-DC-007956-25 continues the
  same controversy and is treated here as a single consolidated case. Devon Tyler
  Barber, appearing pro se, filed a verified counterclaim asserting that NJTA's
  enforcement and fee structure exceed statutory authority and violate
  constitutional safeguards and the public-trust doctrine. The matter is
  proceeding under Judge Dean R. Marcolongo's October 27, 2025 order placing the
  case on Track 1 and authorizing limited discovery.

faith_note: >
  This case examines whether a public authority can lawfully balance revenue
  collection with the moral and constitutional obligation to treat citizens
  fairly. It frames toll enforcement as a test of stewardship under the
  public-trust doctrine: government may administer what belongs to the people,
  but it must do so with transparency, reason, and restraint.

## Plain-English Overview

**Plaintiff's claim**  
The NJTA alleges that between 2016 and 2024, vehicles registered to Devon Tyler Barber
passed through toll facilities without payment, accruing $204 in tolls and $4,905 in
administrative fees. It seeks judgment for $5,109.45, plus interest and costs.

**Defendant's response and counterclaim**  
Barber, representing himself, filed an *Amended Answer and Counterclaim* arguing that:

- NJTA functions as a **statutory corporation**, not a sovereign state entity.  
- A **24-to-1** ratio of fees to tolls exceeds the "reasonable cost" limit in
  N.J.S.A. 27:23-34.3 and N.J.A.C. 19:9-9.2(b).  
- The fee structure implicates the **Excessive Fines Clause**.  
- NJTA's toll operations are bound by the **public-trust doctrine**.  
- Private, non-commercial motorists are entitled to proportional, non-punitive treatment.

Relief sought includes declaratory and injunctive orders defining NJTA's lawful
authority, barring punitive or ultra vires fees, and reaffirming fiduciary duties to
the traveling public.

**Procedural status**  
Earlier collection efforts were docketed as ATL-DC-007956. The current docket,
ATL-DC-007956-25, continues the same dispute and is treated here as one consolidated
case. On October 27, 2025, Judge Marcolongo placed the matter on Track 1 and authorized
limited discovery. Barber served interrogatories and document requests addressing
NJTA's E-ZPass contract with TransCore, foreign-ownership and data-privacy issues
highlighted in Congressman Josh Gottheimer's March 28, 2025 letter, and ADA
accessibility procedures. On November 3, 2025, Barber filed an ADA accommodation
request to confirm scheduling and docketing accuracy. On November 5, 2025, NJTA filed
an Answer to Counterclaim and Affirmative Defenses.

## Key Legal Themes

1. **Public-Trust Doctrine**  
   Agencies managing public infrastructure must act as fiduciaries, not profit centers,
   administering public assets for the benefit of the people.

2. **Proportional Penalties**  
   Administrative fees must reflect actual costs of collection and enforcement, rather
   than serving as punitive or revenue-generating penalties.

3. **Transparency & Data Security**  
   The case tests how a public authority oversees private vendors handling toll and
   location data, especially where foreign ownership and cybersecurity concerns have
   been raised.

4. **ADA Access to Justice**  
   The matter underscores the importance of clear notices, realistic deadlines, and
   reasonable accommodations so that self-represented litigants can meaningfully
   participate in their own defense.
