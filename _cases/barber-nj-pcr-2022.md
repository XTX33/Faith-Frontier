    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      These coordinated petitions seek post-conviction relief under
      <strong>N.J. Ct. R. 3:22</strong>, alleging violations of the
      <strong>Sixth</strong> and <strong>Fourteenth Amendments</strong>.
      Across the related 2022 matters, the filings assert ineffective
      assistance of counsel, suppression or mishandling of exculpatory
      information, and broader due-process defects in charging,
      adjudication, and post-judgment administration.
    </p>

    <h2>Unified Legal Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Whether trial counsel’s performance failed the standard set in
        <em>Strickland v. Washington</em>, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), including
        failures to investigate, advise, or preserve critical defenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether exculpatory or mitigating material was withheld, obscured,
        or disclosed in a manner inconsistent with due process and
        the State’s obligations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether cumulative procedural irregularities, inconsistent
        treatment across related dockets, or record gaps resulted in
        a denial of fundamental fairness under the New Jersey Constitution
        and the Fourteenth Amendment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether post-conviction review itself has been compromised by
        administrative delay, fragmented handling, or bias that frustrates
        the remedial purposes of R. 3:22.
      </li>

    <h2>Procedural Posture</h2>
    <p>
      The 2022 PCR petitions proceed in the Law Division as a unified
      challenge to the underlying convictions and sentences. The court has
      been asked to vacate or modify the judgments where constitutional error
      is established and to schedule an evidentiary hearing under R. 3:22-10(b)
      on disputed factual questions relevant to counsel performance, prejudice,
      and withheld material.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Updated as new orders or filings become available.

    <h2>Context &amp; Purpose</h2>
    <p>

      understanding of New Jersey’s post-conviction review process. By
      consolidating the 2022 records into a single accessible format, it

      the state system.
