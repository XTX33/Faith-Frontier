      Established by a New Jersey tradesman and pro se litigant who spent <strong>108 days in custody before arraignment</strong>,
      navigated wage theft and benefits denials, and now publishes the full record in service of transparency and reform.

      <h2>Faith, Doctrine &amp; Moral Formation</h2>
      <p>
        These reflections emerge from <strong>lived experience</strong>: lost wages, prolonged detention,
        institutional failures, and the ongoing work of grounding Scripture alongside case law and court procedure.

      <h2>Public Trust &amp; Systems Integrity</h2>
      <p>
        Public agencies manage more than paperwork — they manage lives. This section examines how
        toll authorities, motor vehicle agencies, welfare offices, and courts handle
        data, debt, detention, and discretion — and where systems fall short of the public trust.

  <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Faith Frontier was established in response to a season when rumor, political speech, and misread records
    were treated as fact — when a tradesman and small-business owner was detained for over three months before arraignment,
    when wage disputes and benefits decisions moved faster on paper than in real life, and when conscience
    had to remain vigilant through institutional failure.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project transforms that experience into a public resource. It seeks to reconcile
    <strong>due process, public record, and spiritual integrity</strong> — demonstrating what happens
    not only in judicial opinions and press releases, but in the filings, orders, and procedural delays that shape
    ordinary lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe justice should be accessible, understandable, and compassionate — that law
    should be measured not only by what it permits, but by its impact on the people it governs.

      <p>

        (including wage conflicts, benefits appeals, or extended pre-hearing detention).
