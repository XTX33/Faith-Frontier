-  <h2>Why Faith Frontier Exists</h2>
-  <p>
-    Faith Frontier was born out of a season where rumors, political speech, and misread records
-    were treated as facts — where a tradesman and small-business owner was held for months before
-    being seen, where wage disputes and benefits decisions were handled faster on paper than in
-    real life, and where conscience had to fight to stay awake.
-  </p>
-  <p>
-    This project turns that experience outward. It is an attempt to reconcile
-    <strong>due process, public record, and spiritual honesty</strong> — to show what happens
-    not just in opinions and press releases, but in the filings, orders, and delays that shape
-    an ordinary life.
-  </p>
-  <p>
-    We believe justice should be accessible, understandable, and compassionate — that the law
-    should be measured not only by what it permits, but by what it does to the people it touches.
